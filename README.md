# üó£Ô∏è Multi-Voice Cloner Web App (RVC Inference with Flask)

This is a web-based application that allows users to **clone their voice into multiple characters or styles** using RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion). It combines the power of **Flask** (backend) with a patched RVC interface to offer a friendly and creative experience for everyone.

## üöÄ What is this project about?

This project enables users to:
- Upload a short voice clip
- Choose **multiple pretrained voice models**
- Transform the uploaded voice into **different personas**
- **Listen, compare, or download** the results

Whether you're a content creator, educator, or AI enthusiast, this tool lets you explore the power of voice conversion in a simple web app.

## ‚ùó Problems with Existing Solutions

Most existing voice cloning tools:
- Only support **one model at a time**
- Require **technical skills** or command-line knowledge
- Don‚Äôt allow quick **comparison** or **mixing** of multiple voices

This project solves these limitations.

## üí° What‚Äôs Novel About This Project?

- ‚úÖ **Multi-model support** ‚Äî Upload and use multiple RVC voice models in one session  
- üîÅ **Chunk-wise voice transformation** ‚Äî The app divides audio and applies different voices to each part  
- üåê **User-friendly web interface** ‚Äî No coding required, just upload and click  
- üéß **Downloadable results** ‚Äî Save your cloned voices as `.wav` files  
- ‚ö° **Fast and browser-based** ‚Äî Works locally in a simple Flask environment

## üéØ Real-World Use Case

Imagine recording yourself saying:

> ‚ÄúWelcome to the future of voice technology!‚Äù

With this app:
- The **first part** may sound like a **cartoon character**
- The **second** like a **celebrity**
- The **third** like a **robot or singer**

This can be used for:
- üé§ Music and remixing
- üìö Language learning and pronunciation feedback
- üéÆ Game characters and voiceovers
- üéôÔ∏è Podcasting and entertainment
- üß™ AI research and student projects

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. **Upload Audio**: Accepts `.wav` or `.mp3` files.
2. **Upload or Choose Models**: Load `.pth` voice models trained with RVC.
3. **Audio Slicing**: Breaks audio into segments.
4. **Voice Conversion**: Applies each model to a chunk using RVC inference.
5. **Stitch Output**: Merges chunks back into a single `.wav` result.
6. **Download Option**: Final voice clone is downloadable.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- **Flask** ‚Äì Lightweight Python backend framework
- **RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)** ‚Äì Deep learning-based voice conversion engine
- **Python** ‚Äì For preprocessing, inference, and model handling
- **HTML/CSS/JS** ‚Äì For the frontend interface
- **FFmpeg** ‚Äì For audio format handling
